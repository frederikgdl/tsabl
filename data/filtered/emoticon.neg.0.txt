Trying to watch Any Given Sunday on Amazon Prime and there's big chunks of the film cut out 
I'm bummed with Amazon Prime right now. I ordered something and it was supposed to be delivered today, but it wasn't and I leave tomorrow :( 
Yeah, I know it's Sunday delivery &amp; whatnot - and who else does that?! - but my Amazon Prime package is 3 and a half hours late... So far... 
Amazon prime is literally a lie....I ordered a book LAST MONDAY &amp; it still isn't here. do better @amazon 
The ONE time we want to use the Amazon Prime streaming and it's down... grrr ruined my Sunday night! @AmazonUK 
I'm kind of confused why my Amazon Prime stuff that shipped today isn't coming until the 19th-24th. That's certainly not two days. 
Great, my cables have now been bumped from being delivered today to friday. Thanks Amazon Prime, really feeling the worth here. 
Amazon Prime day is pretty much a bust at this point. Black Friday, its up to you to save us. 
Amazon Prime Day? Amazon Scam Day is more like it. More deals than Black Friday my ass! http://t.co/ErRgfAbaXt http://t.co/y73hvTOy9Z

Was the Amazon Prime day a big hit? Well.. there's a #PrimeDayFail hashtag trending. at 5 our @PriceCBS8 reports on what may have gone wrong 
Amazon Prime Day is the equivalent of drinking alone at home on a Friday night. 
This Amazon Prime Day thing is just like Black Friday, if you ignore the part where Amazon didn't put anything you want to buy on sale. 
It didn't live up to the "Black Friday" hype IMO --&gt; Amazon Prime Day leads to sales surge and consumer complaints http://t.co/2QUmJYts5y

@889BrilaFM Chelsea poor form is attributed 2 Jose Mounrinh as he kept faith wid jst d 1st eleven widout putin confidence in his subs. #LHSC 
With Chelsea's poor start to the season it could be 3 points to the 'ammers on October 24th - and I'll be there to see it 
@UtdRantcast @br_uk do you think Chelsea deadline day bid was real or just spin by mufc to try and justify the fee? Think it may be latter 
@Dan_Walsh18 c'mon bruh, you watch Chelsea every week you aren't actually gonna tell me that Oscar works harder due to tackles are you? 
Still in search of the really Dayna Santullo. She's been missing since she willingly passed on a Chris Brown concert on Saturday 
Chris brown is going to be in atx on Wednesday &amp; I'm so so sad I can't see my baby :/ 
All the hoes will be out this Saturday at the Chris brown concert.

@therealgokwan what I hate is when the sun brings out the men who think they look like David Beckham but dont..put it away!! 
David Beckham has expressed his desire to be the next James Bond. He's a good look but his acting may be a deal breaker 
3rd day in LA, STILL not seen David Beckham 
Why is the David Beckham so positive about the England team, we are shite if we don't hit 8/9 on Sat then that is disgraceful set of cretins

David Cameron, The Sun and The Daily Mail make me physically sick. 
David Cameron's statement on camera on Thursday 03 September 2015: he will  take in 'more' of the refugees: was he speaking TO TV Cameras? 
David Cameron is a disgusting liar. Up to his neck in criminality working with corrupt undercover cops, Theresa May covering his back. #GCHQ 
Authoritarian titmouse David Cameron uses the same bullshit to justify drone murdering Brits. @POTUS is so proud: http://t.co/L2blxk5usP 
Pathetic and misleading response by David Cameron to @DanielZeichner's question on 6th form college funding. He obviously just doesn't care. 
Note to IDS: David Cameron may be your friend, but he is not right, and he's certainly not honourable. 
David Cameron knew British pilots were using air strikes on Syria in July, but now refuses to welcome anymore refugees as he calls for peace

Another example of David Cameron campaigning on one thin and then doing the exact Opposite http://t.co/KbbX5sISy9

I'm so frustrated with Game of Thrones and I'm only on the 10th episode 
One of my favorite characters on Game Of Thrones just died I can't go to school tomorrow I'm grieving 
Everytime I reread/re watch Game of Thrones, Ned Starks death at the end of the 1st book/season is the most depressing. #GoT 
Before George R. R. Martin finishes the next book, some of the Game of Thrones actors may die of natural causes. Take your time George.

@KevinInABQ Also, Hillary may begin to give the perception that perhaps she may tend to allow herself to be portrayed as less than accurate. 
@realDonaldTrump may not be my first choice for president, but I'm voting for him if he's nominated. At least he's better than Hillary 
@RufusKings1776 This must be the 20th time this old advice to Hillary has been recycled as "news."  She is who she is. That's her problem. 
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power. 
@davidrook Or Hillary or Sanders.  We may have to rethink this whole democracy thing if someone does not step up after the pre-season. :D 
Hillary looks as comfortable dancing with a child as she is coming out of the closet. https://t.co/A1JRg9Ac89 
Hillary doesn't want to run as Bill's 3rd term. Biden doesn't want to run as Obama's 3rd term. Both want to run as Sanders's 1st term. 
Remember Hillary denied a server existed  ever day ! A liar for President  like Obama this Country will not survive  https://t.co/qfrjOXgSBz 
@tbridis this why people don't believe anything Hillary say this person will soon take the 5th

U know Hillary is panicking when Chelsea Clinton will be speaking at the Amy Schumer show in Boston this Friday.

Sitting here watching Jurassic park: the lost world and remembering why the 1st one is my favorite. #ishouldjustwatchthat 
im so bored i dont want to watch jurassic park for the hundredth time, i just want it to fucking be sunday already.. 
fuck me I took so long to watch jurassic park and kept pausing it and then I sat on the remote and it changed channels and now its live tv 
This is starting to feel like less like a petting zoo &amp; more like Jurassic Park.  ~me at the strip club for lunch on a Wednesday 
So I've found at least 3 different typos in Jurassic Park since I started reading it. C'mon how long has this book been out? 
Fuck a Saturday class I just wanna go home and play with our squirrel and watch Jurassic Park 
I'm all for exploring but this look like the island from Jurassic park lll I may have to skip  https://t.co/ZpQUAcvTKd 
One of the summer's biggest questions: When did we start acting like JURASSIC PARK was an all time classic and not 2nd tier Spielberg? 
Sat through Jurassic World w/ a screaming baby in my ear + a 6 year old climbing up the back of my chair. Ruined my experience @AMCTheatres 
I have the worst urge to watch Jurassic World for the 4th time in theaters someone make it stop 
@AmeliaMangan Plus I may have hurt the feelings of Jurassic World's director! https://t.co/q8r70uUk8n

I'm going to fight Justin tomorrow during lunch idc idc dc

@sassygaycallie I'll share 1st. I don't care for c-Lud because of her weird crush on Justin and how sorority girl she comes across. Ur turn! 
Justin Is lost in the 1st minute. No experience #elxn42 
@_datttass Justin's girl, lost the baby!She was due the 20th... And then placenta had burst inside of her, and the baby wasn't receiving air 
I really wish I didn't have work or school tomorrow bc I'd so be in the city to see Justin right now fuck my life 
It's Justin's funeral tomorrow, it was a pleasure to have known and worked with such a great racer. RIP Badass   https://t.co/HFCoNcJ4Vz 
When the *NSYNC account tweets "tomorrow night they're together again," I want the "they're" to be *NSYNC.  Not Justin and Jimmy.

Lucian Favre having 2nd thoughts about Gladbach qualifying for the Champions League - Juventus, Man City and Sevilla. Group Of Death. 
Only going by the latest game stats but think I may have made a mistake backing juventus 
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal 
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday. 
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season 
As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th). 
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly 
Consult a Dr. If you will watch the 2nd half of Swansea vs ManUtd over Roma vs Juventus match @ 7:00 
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :( 
If Draxler news is true, Juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. May be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2.
